spill - segregated package install logical linker

spill is a program for creating set of symbolic links from one directory
hierarchy which point to corresponding filenames in a separate directory
hierarchy.  It's primary use is to allow packages built from source to be
installed in separate directory trees, which are all linked together under a
common directory tree (e.g. /usr/local) to reduce the length of the PATH
environment variable.  An example might be:

% tar xzvf foobar-0.1.tar.gz
% cd foobar-0.1
% ./configure --prefix=/app/foobar/0.1-1
% make
...
% sudo make install
% sudo spill /app/foobar/0.1-1 /usr/local
%
