New in version 0.6.1
====================

* Add -r/--retain option

New in version 0.5
==================

* -V command line option to show program version
* Multiple single-character flags allowed per command line argument
* Remove -I option.  Replaced by the more flexible solution of allowing
  arbitrarily many ignore_path arguments on the command line, to allow other
  conflicts besides info/dir to be handled.
* Add -o command switch to allow links to new package to override those to
  an existing package when conflicts arise.

New in version 0.4
==================

* New -I command line option, to ignore info/dir files, which cause frequent
  conflicts.
